# CUT
Cartel Update Tool

## About
This is a really simple tool. This just downloads the executable, rather than redownloading the rar file which contains the keybinds file and scripts folder

## Staying up to date
CUT gets its download links from a web api, so no matter where the download moves to, you will always be able to update!

## Instructions
Drag CUT.exe into the same folder as cartel.exe, you are then ready to use the update tool
