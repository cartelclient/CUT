# CUT
Cartel Update Tool

## About
This is a really simple tool. This just downloads the files for you instead of manually. This is because I will NOT be distrubuting on Discord anymore since I got banned.

## Staying up to date
CUT gets its download links from a web api, so no matter where the download moves to, you should always have the latest downloads!
